    I write this blog to share my experiences in STEP. Those who are unfamilier with STEP can refer to https://www.thoughtworks.com/STEP. The STEP stands for Software Technology Excellence Program . It is two year program running by Thoughtworks Technologies Pvt.Ltd . The company will take almost 50 diploma holders from all over india and train them.
    Now I will start to talk about my experiences in Thoughtworks ,STEP. I got selected in Thoughtworks and I came in bangalore on 1st july 2015 from my state Maharashtra. The environment here is free. The workplace is not a cubical.
    I got lot of learnings from here. I got to learn that how to be with strange people. Here I am working with people who are not from my state. But its fun to stay with them. I am getting a lot to learn from them. I am trying to understand their culture and language.
    I have so many friends from  different background and we are enjoying all moments together.
    We have 2 mentors SriJayanth Shridhar and Vivek Haridas(Swamiji) who are teaching us programming language.
    First language we learned here is JavaScript. We did learn C language,data structures,HTML and DBMS(Database Management System).
    And now a days, We are doing project using JavaScript language.
    For project our class gets divided into small group of 5 to 6 members. Each Team has their own game. My team is working on ludo(Kavidikali) board game. Because of project, I did get importance of team work.
    Thoughtworks has 5 branches at different locations in India. First one is in Bangalore then Pune, Chennai, Gurgaon, Hyderabad. So, on coming april we all are going for project in different offices of thoughtworks. I am going to pune for project.

    Apart from this we are doing other things like,
    Cricket - One of my favourite game. I started liking cricket only after coming here. Because swamiji taught the cricket from how to hold bat till how to play good shots.

    Mafia- We play mafia . We were unfamilier with this game. But Jayanth taught us this game.I found it more interesting while playing with bunch of people. From this game I did learn how to convince people and how to present our point in front of people if we have enough knowledge and enough evidence about topic.
    We watch movies also.
    Swamiji usually told us about share markets, How share market works,How funds ,debit and credit works,insurance,investment and so many things about finance. So we get a lot to learn because of that.
    Jayanth spent a lot of time to made me realize that what all the things will make difference when I am doing programming. he told us importance of planning,preparation and spending some time with ourself and knowing ourself.  

    Our STEP advisor is Ganesh Sir. He make us to think about the changes after coming here. He always gave us feedback. And try to know about our progress. We always share our difficulties and happy moments with him.
    
    One of our mentor is Trishna Mam. She is very friendly. I got many learnings from her about food, habits,general knowledge. She always kept a book with her which has some valuable contents. And sometimes she read some lines from the book for us and shared the thoughts within. If I become nervous, she will console me. She will take care of us.

    After coming here I started to break my comfort zone. I went with my friends to Kerala (The Gods Own Country). It was  strange place for me. but I enjoyed a lot. I visited many beautiful places there.
    Here, We are a family. We know each other and we are helping each other in their problems. We are enjoying here with our studies.

    Thats all I want to write.
