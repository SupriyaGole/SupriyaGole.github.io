  Hello Friends,
   Today, I am writing this blog to share my experience in STEP. Before starting i should say about what a STEP is. So, STEP stands for Software Technology Excellence Program . It is 2 year program running by Thoughtworks Technologies Pvt.Ltd . The company will take almost 50 diploma holders from all over india and train them.
   Now i will start to talk about my experience in Thoughtworks ,STEP. I got selected in Thoughtworks and i came in bangalore on 1st july 2015. The environment here is free. The people here work in openspace. The working space is not block type.
   I got lot of learnings here. I got to learn that how to be with people whom you didnt know. Here I am working with people who are not from my state. But its fun to stay with them. i am getting lot to learn from them. I am getting to learn their language and i am understanding their language.
   I have so many friends from  different background and we enjoy all movements together.
   Oh, I didnt talk about out mentors. We have 2 mentors Jayanth and Vivek Haridas(Swamiji) who are teaching us programming language and so many things.
   In that so many things i will list following things that we have learnt from them.
   Cricket - One of my favourite game. Think is that i started liking cricket only after coming here. Because swamiji teaches the cricket from base. from how to hold bat till how to play good shots , how to hit the ball and all.

   Mafiya- We plays mafiya . We were not familier with this game. But Jayanth told us about this game. And I find it more interesting while playing with bunch of people. From this game I learnt how to convince people and how to present our point in front of people if we have enough knowledge and enough evidence about topic.

   They taught many things other than programming. Like about share markets, How share market works,How so many funds ,companies work. about insurance,investment and so many things about finannce. So we get a lot to learn because of that.

   I didnt mension about Trishna mam. She is also one of the mentor. She is very nice. I got many learnings from her. about food habits, and if i become upset then she will concern me. She will take care of we all. All mentors takes care of we all a lot.

   After coming here i started to break my confort zone. I went with my friends to kerala , The unknown state. but I enjoyed a lot. Now a days, We are working on different projects , Because of that we are getting to know the importance of team work and benifits of working in team. And with all this work also we are playing games,watching movies and enjoying a lot.

   Thats all, i wanted to write.
